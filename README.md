# Dark Age of Camelot Item Database
Simple page to display items from DAOC json data dump provided by Broadsword.

**This is a work in progress**. 

Right now it's just showing simple text displays (The in-game "delve") of the items

You can test it out [HERE](https://rawgit.com/CynicalJedi/daoc-item-db/master/index.html).  
    *Warning: The above page is hosted via github and can be a little slow to initially load.*

I'm considering adding these features (when I have time):
* Ability to search individual fields
* Ability to view raw JSON for each item
* Ability to export an item as XML (for import into Loki)

I'm not a web developer. This is the first time I've played with something like this, I'm sure there are more/better ways to implement it. Feel free to contribute.
